* Study how BFS Algorithms can be implemented in Erlang. Implement them. Compare them. 

* Different ways we can represent the tree 
** TODO Adjacency Matrix

** TODO Hash Array Mapped Tries 
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.21.6279
** Recursive Structure 
*** TODO The erlang equivalent of  Tree -> Leaf | Value [Chilren of type Tree]
*** DONE Another way to do is : [(Value,Int, [Int])] -> [(Value,ParentID, [Children_ID])]

** TODO EdgePairs 
- Get the number of nodes, and a list of all connected edges 

* Distributed / Sequential? 
- Should the algorithm be distributed?                                             
- Will Sequential Suffice?
