# Study how BFS Algorithms can be implemented in Erlang. Implement them. Compare them

## Tasks 

	[X] Sequential BFS : Ujwal
	[ ] Distributed BFS with Shared Mem - FIFO: Ujwal
	[ ] Distributed BFS with Shared Mem - Bag(DSU) : Athreya (If we are even doing this)
	[ ] Distributed BFS with Distributed Mem - 1D: Aaron
	[ ] Distributed BFS with Distributed Mem - 2D: Aaron
	[ ] Generate data and benchmark all the systems : Athreya 

## Algorithms

### Sequential BFS

	```
	for i in nodes
		if !vis[i]:
			vis[i]
			bfs(i)
	```

### Distributed BFS with Shared Mem
