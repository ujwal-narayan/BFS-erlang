# Study how BFS Algorithms can be implemented in Erlang. Implement them. Compare them

## Tasks 

	
- [x] Sequential BFS : Ujwal
- [ ] Distributed BFS with Shared Mem FIFO : Ujwal
- [ ] Distributed BFS with Shared Mem - Bag(DSU) : Athreya (If we are even doing this)
- [ ] Distributed BFS with Distributed Mem - 1D: Aaron
- [ ] Distributed BFS with Distributed Mem - 2D: Aaron
- [ ] Generate data and benchmark all the systems : Athreya 

## To Run Tests
```
python3 test.py <module name without extension>
```
For Example
```
python3 test.py SeqBFS
```
